## Security

This Docker image has been thoroughly scanned for vulnerabilities to ensure a secure environment for your React.js application. The image has passed all vulnerability assessments using Docker's built-in security tools, including Docker Scout. Regular updates to the base image and dependencies are recommended to maintain a high level of security.

### Build and Run with Docker Manually

If you prefer to build and run the container manually, use the following commands:

```sh
docker build -t  react-js-app .
docker run -d --name react-js-app-container -p 3000:8080 react-js-app
```

---

## Stopping and Removing Containers

To stop and remove the running container, use:

```sh
docker stop  react-js-app-container && docker rm react-js-app-container
```

## Logs and Debugging

To check container logs:

```sh
docker logs -f react-js-app-container
```

To access the running container shell:

```sh
docker exec -it react-js-app-container sh
```

## Customizing the Build

To change the Node.js version, update the `NODE_VERSION` variable in the Dockerfile.

To use a different Nginx version, modify the `NGINX_VERSION` variable in the Dockerfile or `.env` file.
